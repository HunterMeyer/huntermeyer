      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style='margin-bottom: 10px'>
        I'm a left handed, blue-eyed fella who enjoys programming, traveling, strumming the guitar, playing yard games and board games, watching movies, and cooking out with the family. I spent the first 12 years of my life up in New York before moving on down to sunny Florida. After graduating from UCF and getting acquired in 2012, I relocated to the highlands of Denver, CO. I miss snowboarding. While wizzing away at mobile marketing and business development I caught the programming bug! A year later I moved back home, taught myself the basics of programming and decided to move to Portland, OR to attend a coding bootcamp. Four months later, I find myself here in Alpharetta, GA at a kick ass Rails shop churning out code! <br>
        I recently started getting into building iOS and Android apps. I'm excited for my future and I love my girlfriend!
